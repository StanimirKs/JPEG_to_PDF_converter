This is a simple image to pdf converter, which I decided to make, because I got sick of using different software, 
that offered me paid subscriptions and plans non stop, and I wanted to see if I can make something like that.
Consider it a personal challenge of sort.


	!! DISCLAIMER !! 
The .pdf file with the gibberish for name in the repo is a result of an earlier version of the app, which saved the files directly to the project folder.
It took some time to change the way the app saves files, so I forgot what the image was at the time of commiting the changes, and when I got the message from git that a file was added, i panicked a bit, because I didn't 
recognize the name, and thought something was wrong. It was quite funny when I saw what the image was, so I decided to keep it
as an easter egg :)
